-- Could NOT find Qt6ShaderTools (missing: Qt6ShaderTools_DIR)
CMake Warning at /usr/share/cmake-3.28/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt6Quick3DRuntimeRender/Qt6Quick3DRuntimeRenderConfig.cmake

  but it set Qt6Quick3DRuntimeRender_FOUND to FALSE so package
  "Qt6Quick3DRuntimeRender" is considered to be NOT FOUND.  Reason given by
  package:

  Qt6Quick3DRuntimeRender could not be found because dependency
  Qt6ShaderTools could not be found.

  Configuring with --debug-find-pkg=Qt6ShaderTools might reveal details why
  the package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.
